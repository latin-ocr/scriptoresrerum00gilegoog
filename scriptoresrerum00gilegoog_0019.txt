public libi-ary at Douay, about which we shall have
occasion to speak again in the second volume of this
work.

14. Charta a reye Willelmo concessa, Anylo-saoeonice
scripta. This chal-ter is copied from a MS. in the British
Museum, Jul. C ΙΙ. f. 606. It is a curious relic of the
vernacular language of that day, of which we have too
few specimens remaining.

15. Da roi Guillaumc &Anyleterra par Cho-etiem dc
Troyes was published in Michel's Chroniques Anglo-Nor-
mandes, Bouen 8vo. 1840, from a large MS. belonging to
the Bibliotheqae du roi Paris [No. 6987] of the -four-
teenth century, containing· other legende and French
romances with which we are not now concerned,

16. The concluding article is another French poem
entitled Le dir, de audalaum d'Angleterre, taken from
another MS. preserved in the king's library at PariS,
[Notre Dame 198] and. published by Michel in the same
volume with the last.

Such are the contente of this volume3 which will be
speedily followed by another containing the remaining
tracte connected with the reign of william the Con-
queror, and the three other Anglo-Norman kings of
England.
