anonymous biographical, poetieal and other pieces, which ·
often throw more light on the period to which they
belong, than the more bulky collections above-mentioned.

It is this class of documents with which we are now
· concerned, and the reader is presented, in these vol-
umes, with all such minor pieces connected with the
reigns of the Anglo-Norman kings, william the Conqueror‚

’ william Rufus, Hem-y I and Stephen‚ as the editor has

been able to get together. It is hoped that almost every
thing extant calculated from its authentic antiquity to
illustrate the reigns of these sovereigns has been collected,
save only, as aforesaid, the information which is to be
sought for in the larger chronicles, the works of Lanfranc
and Anselm, with the charters and the ecclesiastical
councils.

It would be desirable that a similar plan should be
adopted for concentrating the minor authentic memoriale
of all our English kings from the earliest period, and such
a plan may perhaps, be realized in an age like the
present which is beginning to be distinguished for his-
torica] research.

Let us now enumerate the different articles contained
in this first volume, and the sources from which they
have been obtained.

1. The first of the pieces contained in this volume
is a short but very satisfactory memoir of the con-
queror and his three sons, entitled “Brevis relatio de
Willelmo nobilissimo comite Nomannomm, quie fuit et
unde oriyinem duoeit et quo haereditario jure Anqliam
sibi armis acquisivit. The author, whose name is
unknown, lived in the reign of Henry I, as we learn from
his own words in page 13, [line five from the bottom]
