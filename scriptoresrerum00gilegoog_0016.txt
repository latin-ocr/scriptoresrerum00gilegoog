manuscript copy of this poem known to exist is found
in a quarto volume of the twelfth century preserved in
the Burgundian library at Brussels: but it bears no in-
dication of the author’s name, and Pertz was induced to
ascribe it to Guy, orWido, from a fanciful interpretation
of the letters L. W. which occur in the second line,
These letters he conceives to represent Lansramum
Wido. This is certainly, but a slender base on which to
creet such an argument, but it derives support from the
known fact that Wido was the author of such a poem.
It has been printed before in the third volume of
Michel’s Chrom’quee Anyto-Normandoe‚ Reum, Svo.
1840, and more accurately in a volume which has never
been published, by the late Record Commission. The
text of this last-named edition is so accurate, that no
farther collation of the original manuscript seems
necessary. Resides the poem on the battle of Hastings,
Guy of Amiens is the author of an epitaph on Ingel-
rannus abbat of St. Riquier, written in 1043, when Guy
was archdeacon of Amicus. As this epitaph completes
the writings of Guy of Amicus, we introduce it here
from Mabillon's Acta Sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti, sec.
VI, par. I, page 507.
Quem tegit hic tumulus, lectissimus Angelirannus‚
Hujus coenobii pastor et abba fuit-‚3
Dux gregis egregiae, monachum spes inclyta vitae.
Vixit et in mundo mundus etin Domino.
