among the letters of Lanfranc. It is most appropriate
in this volume, as shewing the spirit in which the great
Conqueror resisted the Pope’s claim of temporal superi-
ority.

6. Eoecerpta de vita Willelmz· Conquestoris. This tract,
as appears by the rubric with which. it begins, was taken
out of an ancient volume belonging to the M onastery of
St. Stephen's, at Caen. 11 was published by Camden in
his Anylica Britannica 810. from a M S. preserved in the
College at Arms, but 1116 learned editor took no notice of
a hiatus which we have marked in our edition by a break
in the text [see page 55]. It turns out that the M S. also
from which he printed it, takes no notice of this hiatuS,
having evidently been copied from another written about
1116 year 1350, 11111011 is now preserved in the British
Museum [Vesp. A. XIX], and in which the same hiatus
0001118, occasioned by the loss of one or more of the
leaveS. But the fact is, that this tract is no more than
an extract from the seventh book of Ordericus Vitalis.

As however it relates to william the Conqueror, and
had been before published by Camden, 116 have retained
it in this place just as it stands in the MSS. above men-
tioned, which have again been carefully collated.

7. De morte Willelmi Conquestoria Copied from a
MS. in the British Museum [Cott. Claud. C. VI, fc. 1650]
and bearing interna] evidence of having been written
soon after William’s death. ‘

8. Hymnus de morte Willclmz‘ Conquestoris. This
poem is found in a MS. of the Royal Library at Paris,
No. 8625, which contains 133 letters of John of Salis-
bury. It appears to be coeval with the death of the Con-
queror to which it refers.

9. De morte Lanfranci is taken from MS. Cott. Claud.
