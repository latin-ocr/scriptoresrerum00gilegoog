C. VI, fo. 165, and is also no doubt a contemporary doen-
ment.

10. The next work is of a more important character,
being in fact the source from which we obtain most
of our information concerning the life of the first
William. The Gesta Willelmi, by William of Poitiers‚
was first published by Duchesne, among the Scriptores
rerum Normanm'camm, from a MS. that had been lent

to him by Sir R. Cotton. This MS. was never returned

tion or still exists unnoticed on the shelves of some pro-
vincial library. The work was again printed by Maseres
in a volume entitled Historiae Anylicanae circa tempus
conquestus Anylioe a Gulielmo Noth, Normannorum
duce, selecta monumenta, Lond, 4to. 1807. The whole
of that volume will be included in the present collection,
except the Encomium Emmae, of which the English His-
torical society are preparing an edition, and the extracts
from Ordericus Vitalis‚ which it seems unnecessaryr to re-
print, because a new edition of the whole of that author
will no doubt before long issue from the press.

11. Excerptum ea: cantatorio S. Huberti. The can*
tatorium of St. Hubert is of no importance to our present
subject: but this extract from it gives us some curious
information about Hugh, the celebrated Bishop of Lin-

Burgundian library at Brussels [No. 14,600, p. 26].

12. Annalis Historia brevis sive Chronica monasterii
S. Stephani Cadomeneis. This short chronicle was
printed by Duchesne and Maseres: it is here reprinted
from their text.

13. Carmen de morte Lansranci. This poem is copied
from a very ancient and valuable MS. belonging to the
